## AWS and Azure Cloud Service Map 

This document helps you quickly compare the cloud capabilities of Azure and AWS services in all categories. Whether you are planning a multi-cloud solution with Azure and AWS, or simply migrating to Azure, you will be able to use this service map to quickly orient yourself with the services required for a successful migration. You can use the service map side-by-side with other useful resources found in our documentation.

The cloud service map ([PDF available](http://aka.ms/awsazureguide) for download) is broken out into 13 sections to make navigation between each service simple:

1. [Marketplace](/section/marketplace.md) – Cloud marketplace services bring together native and partner service offerings to a single place, making it easier for customers and partners to understand what they can do.
2. [Compute](/section/compute.md) – Compute commonly refers to the collection of cloud computing resources that your application can run on.
3. [Storage](/section/storage.md) – Storage services offer durable, highly-available, and massively-scalable cloud storage for your application, whether it runs in the cloud or not.
4. [Networking & Content Delivery](/section/networking.md) – Allows you to easily provision private networks, connect your cloud application to your on-premises datacenters, and more.
5. [Database](/section/database.md) – Database services refers to options for storing data, whether it’s a managed relational SQL database that’s globally distributed or multi-model NoSQL databases designed for any scale.
6. [Analytics and big data](/section/analytics.md) – Make the most informed decision possible by analyzing all of the data you need in real time.
7. [Intelligence](/section/intelligence.md) – Intelligence services enable natural and contextual interaction within your applications, using machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities that include text, speech, vision, and search.
8. [Internet of Things (IoT)](/section/iot.md) – Internet of Things (IoT) services connect your devices, assets, and sensors to collect and analyze untapped data.
9. [Management & monitoring](/section/management.md) – Management and monitoring services provide visibility into the health, performance, and utilization of your applications, workloads, and infrastructure.
10. [Mobile services](/section/mobile.md) – Mobile services enable you to reach and engage your customers everywhere, on every device. DevOps services make it easier to bring a higher quality app to market faster, and a number of engagement services make it easier to deliver performant experiences that feel tailored to each user.
11. [Security, identity, and access](/section/security.md) – A range of capabilities that protect your services and data in the cloud, while also enabling you to extend your existing user accounts and identities, or provisioning entirely new ones.
12. [Developer tools](/section/devtools.md) – Developer tools empower you to quickly build, debug, deploy, diagnose, and manage multi-platform, scalable apps and services.
13. [Enterprise integration](/section/enterpriseintegration.md) – Enterprise integration makes it easier to build and manage B2B workflows that integrate with third-party software-as-a-service apps, on-premises apps, and custom apps.
